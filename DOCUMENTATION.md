# ü§ù Collaborative Features

## Overview

Host-controlled collaborative sessions where one person controls photo capture and everyone's photos combine into a single strip!

## How It Works

### For the Host:

1. **Create Session** - Click "Create Collaborative Session"
2. **Share Code** - Give the 6-digit code to friends (e.g., ABC123)
3. **Wait for Participants** - See "üë• 2/4 participants" as friends join
4. **Select Photos** - Choose total number of photos (2, 3, or 4)
5. **Trigger Capture** - Click "üëë Capture All (Host)" when everyone is ready
6. **Photos Distribute** - System divides photos among participants automatically
7. **Create Strip** - Click "üéâ Create Collaborative Strip" to combine everyone's photos

### For Participants:

1. **Join Session** - Click "Join Session" and enter the code
2. **Get Camera Ready** - Position yourself for photos
3. **Wait for Host** - Your button shows "‚è≥ Waiting for Host..."
4. **Auto-Capture** - Your camera captures automatically when host triggers
5. **Photos Sync** - Your photos upload to the collaborative session

## Photo Distribution

Photos are divided **equally** among all participants:

| Total Photos | Participants | Photos Each |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 4 photos     | 2 people     | 2 each      |
| 4 photos     | 3 people     | 1 each      |
| 4 photos     | 4 people     | 1 each      |
| 2 photos     | 2 people     | 1 each      |

**Formula:** `Photos per person = Total photos √∑ Number of participants`

## Session Limits

- **Maximum 4 participants** (including host)
- **Maximum 4 total photos** selected by host
- Sessions remain active while participants connected
- Automatic cleanup after 30 seconds of inactivity

## Real-Time Notifications

- "üì∏ [Name] just took a photo!" - Someone captures
- "üì∏ Capturing group photo! Everyone smile!" - Host triggers
- "‚ú® Collaborative strip created!" - Combined strip ready

## Collaborative Strip

The final collaborative strip shows:
- ‚úÖ All photos from all participants in one strip
- ‚úÖ Each person's name under their photo
- ‚úÖ Dynamic grid layout based on photo count
- ‚úÖ Date and session information
- ‚úÖ List of all participants
- ‚úÖ Downloadable for everyone

3. Refresh page and try again
4. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. HTTPS required (localhost or deployed site)

### Black Screen / No Preview

2. Restart browser
3. Check camera works in other apps
4. Update browser to latest version

## Photo & Gallery Issues

### Photos Not Saving to Gallery

**For Logged-In Users:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify logged in (not guest mode)
3. Check Firebase Storage enabled
4. Check Storage rules configured
5. Browser console (F12) for errors

**For Guest Users:**
- Working as designed! Guest mode doesn't save photos
- Sign in to enable gallery

### Gallery Empty After Sign-In

1. Did you take photos while signed in?
2. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage for uploaded files
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check signed in with correct account

### Can't See Photos from Other Device

1. Signed in with **same account** on both devices?
2. Photos actually uploaded? (Check Firebase Storage)
3. Hard refresh on second device
4. Check internet connection on both devices

## Collaborative Session Issues

**Check:**

# üí° Tips & Best Practices

## For Best Photos

1. **Good Lighting** - Natural light or bright indoor lighting
2. **Plain Background** - Simple backgrounds look better
3. **Center Yourself** - Use the live preview to position
4. **Strike Different Poses** - Vary your poses for each photo
5. **Have Fun!** - Vintage filters hide imperfections

## For Collaborative Sessions

1. **Communicate** - Tell participants when you'll trigger
2. **Test First** - Do a test run before the real photos
3. **Count Together** - "3... 2... 1..." helps synchronize
4. **Good WiFi** - All participants need stable internet
5. **Clear Codes** - Read session codes carefully (O vs 0, I vs 1)

## For Gallery Management

1. **Sign In Early** - Don't lose photos by using guest mode
2. **Download Favorites** - Keep local copies of best photos
3. **Regular Cleanup** - Delete unwanted photos to save space
4. **Organize Sessions** - Use descriptive header text

## For Privacy

1. **Guest Mode for Events** - Use guest mode for public photobooths
2. **Logout When Done** - Always logout on shared devices
3. **Delete Unwanted** - Remove photos you don't want to keep
4. **Private Gallery** - Only you can see your photos (logged in)
